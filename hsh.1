hsh \- simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.RI [ command_file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple implementation of a UNIX command interpreter.
It reads commands from standard input (interactive mode) or from a file/script (non-interactive mode), and then executes the commands using the system calls
.BR fork (2),
.BR execve (2),
and
.BR wait (2).

In interactive mode, a
.B $
prompt is displayed to invite the user to type a command.

.SH FEATURES
